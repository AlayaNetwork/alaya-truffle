   * Watches a mapping key; adds it to the decoder's list of watched mapping
   * keys.  This affects the results of both [[variables|variables()]] and

   * its watched keys will be included in its value.
   *
   * Note that it is possible
   * to watch mappings that are inside structs, arrays, other mappings, etc;
   * see below for more on how to do this.
   *
   * Note that watching mapping keys is
   * only possible in full mode; if the decoder wasn't able to start up in full
   * mode, this method will throw an exception.
   *
   * **Warning**: At the moment, this function does very little to check its
   * input.  Bad input may have unpredictable results.  This will be remedied
   * in the future (by having it throw exceptions on bad input), but right now
   * essentially no checking is implemented.  Also, there may be slight changes
   * to the format of indices in the future.
   *
   * (A bad variable name will cause an exception though; that input is checked.)
   * @param variable The variable that the mapping lives under; this works like
   *   the nameOrId argument to [[variable|variable()]].  If the mapping is a
   *   top-level state variable, put the mapping itself here.  Otherwise, put the
   *   top-level state variable it lives under.
   * @param indices Further arguments to watchMappingKey, if given, will be
   *   interpreted as indices into or members of the variable identified by the
   *   variable argument; see the example.  Array indices and mapping
   *   keys are specified by value; struct members are specified by name or (if
   *   you know it) numeric ID.
   *
   *   Numeric values can be given as number, BN, or
   *   numeric string.  Bytestring values are given as hex strings.  Boolean
   *   values are given as booleans, or as the strings "true" or "false".
   *   Address values are given as hex strings; they are currently not required
   *   to be in checksum case, but this will likely change in the future, so
   *   don't rely on that.
   *
   *   Note that if the path to a given mapping key
   *   includes mapping keys above it, any ancestors will also be watched
   *   automatically.
   * @example First, a simple example.  Say we have a mapping `m` of type
   *   `mapping(uint => uint)`.  You could call `watchMappingKey("m", 0)` to
   *   watch `m[0]`.
   * @example Now for a slightly more complicated example.  Say `m` is of type
   *   `mapping(uint => mapping(uint => uint))`, then to watch `m[3][5]`, you
   *   can call `watchMappingKey("m", 3, 5)`.  This will also automatically
   *   watch `m[3]`; otherwise, watching `m[3][5]` wouldn't do much of
   *   anything.
   * @example Now for a well more complicated example.  Say we have a struct
   *   type `MapStruct` with a member called `map` which is a `mapping(string => string)`,
   *   and say we have a variable `arr` of type `MapStruct[]`, then one could
   *   watch `arr[3].map["hello"]` by calling `watchMappingKey("arr", 3, "map", "hello")`.
